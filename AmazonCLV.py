# Step 1: Upload the file
uploaded = files.upload()

# Step 2: Load the dataset
file_name = list(uploaded.keys())[0]  # Get the uploaded file name
data = pd.ExcelFile(file_name)  # Load the Excel file
df = data.parse('AmazonFoodCategory_1 Dataset')  # Load the relevant sheet

# Step 3: Data Preparation - Select relevant columns for regression
# Example: Using Sales Amount as dependent and Discount Amount, List Price, and Sales Quantity as independent
df = df[['Sales Amount', 'Discount Amount', 'List Price', 'Sales Quantity']]

# Drop rows with missing values
df = df.dropna()

# Step 4: Define dependent and independent variables
X = df[['Discount Amount', 'List Price', 'Sales Quantity']]  # Independent variables
y = df['Sales Amount']  # Dependent variable

# Add a constant to the independent variables (for the intercept)
X = sm.add_constant(X)

# Step 5: Fit the regression model
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()

# Step 6: Display the regression summary

# Step 3: Data Preparation
# Check for missing values in the dataset
print("Missing values per column:\n", df.isnull().sum())

# Drop rows with missing values (optional: replace with mean/median if necessary)

# Verify there are no infinite or NaN values
